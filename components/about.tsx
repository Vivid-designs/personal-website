              There&apos;s nothing more satisfying than solving a problem
              that&apos;s been around for a while and nobody else knows how to
              solve. As a software developer, I constantly provide solutions for
              users&apos; problems. I can be working on the occasional quick fix
              as well as more complex strategic solutions.

            <TypographyP className="mt-2">
              Great fundamentals built up from university. I am always curious
              and love to stay updated to the latest technology. Also, I love
              challenges and I don&apos;t give up. With the advantages of
              bilingual, I am able to connect and collaborate with developers
              around the world.
