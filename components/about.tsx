              A passionate Computer Science graduate chasing his dreams.
              Originated in Hong Kong, currently living in the capital of the UK
              â€” London. Giving me the ability to read and write fluently in two

              Why do I love software development so much?
            </h3>
            <TypographyP>
              There's nothing more satisfying than solving a problem that's been
              around for a while and nobody else knows how to solve. As a
              software developer, I constantly provide solutions for users'
              problems. I can be working on the occasional quick fix as well as
              more complex strategic solutions.

              Then, what makes me a good software engineer?
            </h3>
            <TypographyP>
              Great fundamentals built up from university. I am always curious
              and love to stay updated to the latest technology. Also, I love
              challenges and I don't give up. With the advantages of bilingual,
              I am able to connect and collaborate with developers around the
              world.
